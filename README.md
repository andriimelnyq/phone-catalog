[DEMO](https://andriimelnyq.github.io/phone-catalog/)

This is a comprehensive web application that utilizes React as its base. Super responsive layout of the catalog implemented following [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/uEetgWenSRxk9jgiym6Yzp/Phone-catalog-redesign). The React router library is used for all site navigation, while the development process incorporates the SASS preprocessor, the BEM methodology, and various third-party libraries, including Lodash, Swiper, React-select, React-paginate, React-transition-group. The server provides product information via a GET request, which is then stored in a context. Users can sort a list of products, search by product name or change the count on the page by pagination. The application allows users to add products to their cart, view them, and adjust the quantity, with the order amount being automatically calculated. Additionally, users can add products to their "favorites" category. Cart and favorites products are stored in localStorage and persist even after the site or browser is reloaded.
